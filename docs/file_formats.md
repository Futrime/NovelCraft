# File Formats

This section contains information about the various file formats used by NovelCraft.

For enthusiasts, with a little bit of programming knowledge, you can create your own custom blocks, items, entities, and more. The only thing you need to do is to create a JSON file according to the formats described here and put it in the right place. These kinds of files are placed in the `definitions` folder of the game directory. For example, if you want to create a new block, you need to create a JSON file in the `definitions/blocks` folder.

So can you write your own post-processing scripts to analyze the data recorded by NovelCraft? You can do that too. The `worlds/<level name>/records` folder contains all the data recorded by NovelCraft. You can write your own scripts to analyze the data in this folder.

For details, please refer to the [schemas](https://github.com/NovelCraft/Documentation/tree/main/schemas/files).
