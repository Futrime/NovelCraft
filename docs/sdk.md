# NovelCraft SDK

To free the developers from the tedious work of writing the same code over and over again, we have created the NovelCraft SDK. It is a set of tools that can be used to create an agent in a short time. To support multiple development languages, we have created a set of SDKs for different languages. The SDKs are available in the following languages:

- .NET(C#, F#, VB.NET): [NovelCraft SDK for .NET](https://dotnet.sdk.novelcraft.games)

- Python: [NovelCraft SDK for Python](https://python.sdk.novelcraft.games)

If you want to create an agent in a language that is not listed above, you can directly communicate with the server using [the protocols](/protocols.md) via WebSocket.
